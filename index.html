        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-1" class="check-item"><label for="check-1" id="checklist-item-1">Check the water bottle or bowl. Make sure it is full, clean, and functioning properly. Change the water regularly (empty the old water into the sink and replace it with fresh water).</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-2" class="check-item"><label for="check-2" id="checklist-item-2">Ensure they have an unlimited supply of hay. Refill the hay dispenser to its maximum capacity. Add an extra handful of hay directly into the litter box, in front of the hay dispenser.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-3" class="check-item"><label for="check-3" id="checklist-item-3">Lightly fill each bowl with fresh romaine lettuce. Wash and rinse the lettuce thoroughly before serving. Add one scoop of pellets to each bowl.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-4" class="check-item"><label for="check-4" id="checklist-item-4">Ensure they are active, hopping around, and eating as usual. Watch for signs of lethargy or excessive hiding. They should approach you when they see food.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-5" class="check-item"><label for="check-5" id="checklist-item-5">Confirm that their living area is at a safe temperature (between 60-70°F) and free from drafts or heat sources.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-6" class="check-item"><label for="check-6" id="checklist-item-6">Examine their eyes and ears for any signs of discharge, redness, or infection.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-7" class="check-item"><label for="check-7" id="checklist-item-7">Check their droppings to ensure they are healthy. Look for small, firm, round pellets. If they are soft, watery, or absent, consult a vet immediately.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-8" class="check-item"><label for="check-8" id="checklist-item-8">Brush them regularly to prevent matting and remove loose fur. Use the brush that is laid out on the kitchen counter.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-8" class="check-item"><label for="check-8" id="checklist-item-8">Ensure they are not chewing on the carpet or anything else.</label></li>
        <li><input type="checkbox" id="check-9" class="check-item"><label for="check-9" id="checklist-item-9">Check that they are not chewing on anything inappropriate, such as carpet or furniture. Remove any dangerous items from their cage, as chewing can cause blockages or harm them. Rabbits chew out of boredom, but this behavior can be dangerous if left unchecked.</label></li>

      <h2>General Rabbit Care Tips</h2>
      <p>Rabbits require a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper grooming. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>Rabbits should have unlimited access to fresh hay, such as timothy hay. Fresh vegetables, like leafy greens, should be added to their diet daily. Pellets are also necessary but should be limited to avoid obesity.</p>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are active animals and need plenty of space to hop and explore. Set up a safe area for them to play and exercise for at least a few hours a day.</p>
      <h3>Grooming</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are naturally clean, but they need regular grooming. Long-haired breeds especially require frequent brushing to prevent matting. Check their nails monthly and trim them as necessary.</p>
