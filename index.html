      <h2>General Rabbit Care Tips</h2>
      <p>Rabbits require a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper grooming. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
      <h3>Diet</h3>
      <p>Rabbits should have unlimited access to fresh hay, such as timothy hay. Fresh vegetables, like leafy greens, should be added to their diet daily. Pellets are also necessary but should be limited to avoid obesity.</p>
      <h3>Exercise</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are active animals and need plenty of space to hop and explore. Set up a safe area for them to play and exercise for at least a few hours a day.</p>
      <h3>Grooming</h3>
      <p>Rabbits are naturally clean, but they need regular grooming. Long-haired breeds especially require frequent brushing to prevent matting. Check their nails monthly and trim them as necessary.</p>
